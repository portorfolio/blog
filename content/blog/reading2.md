## The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
This makes me think back to one of the first questions asked in class, which was something about whether social media is a positive or negative thing. My answer to that was how it's both, but I think for many who acknowledge that social media has negative parts to it, reading this kind of amplifies that view. Like, one might think they're connecting with others (which they are) and receiving news (which they also are), but every single thing is being...tracked/documented and used for profit in one way or another. It seems like this chapter greatly emphasizes how the main factor of profit is not the product being sold, but rather the human experience they receive from people using the products and turning it into something more.

I think it's interesting how it's became where convenience and effectiveness of life means the compromise of privacy and security. I also find the idea of the unprecedented interesting, since the author mentions it a lot. They also bring up a good point, of how companies try to justify this concept of surveillance capitalism by claiming that for their products to function as intended, personal data must be collected.

## Facebook and Ads
This article doesn't come as a huge surprise to me. Even though there's no specific targeting categories for ads now, companies find a way around it and still target specific groups. I think it ties in with the first reading, how whatever you interact with or see on the internet is being tracked, and companies know that. Doesn't seem like they need Facebook to provide a list of categories of people to target when putting out ads when they have so much of your personal data already.
